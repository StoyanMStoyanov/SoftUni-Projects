Storage area networks (SANs), host bus adapters (HBAs), and logical unit numbers (LUNs)
were once the sole domain of storage specialists, far removed from the expertise of
your average Windows administrator. However, the arrival of new technologies, such as the
Windows Virtual Disk service and Internet SCSI (iSCSI), along with the increasingly complex

upon this storage information to introduce the various clustering technologies available in
Windows Server 2008 R2
